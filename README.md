##  About This Repository

**Re-SISR** is a personal repository dedicated to training and fine-tuning Deep Learning models for Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR).

The primary focus is **Artistic Restoration** (Anime/Manga/Illustration).

> **Note:** To keep this repository clean, all model showcases, changelogs, and the detailed **Model Zoo** have been moved to the [Project Dashboard](https://renarchi.github.io/Re-SISR/).

---

##  Usage & Downloads

*   **Public Models:** Stable model weights (e.g., `4x_Alchemy`) are available on the [Releases Page](https://github.com/renarchi/Re-SISR/releases).

*   **Showcase Models:** Work-in-Progress (WIP) models (e.g., `Fallin_re`) currently in training. They are previewed on the dashboard and will be released publicly upon completion.
